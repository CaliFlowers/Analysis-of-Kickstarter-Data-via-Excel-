# Analysis-of-Kickstarter-Data-via-Excel-

Microsoft Excel is the most basic tool in a Data Analyst's toolbox. Most data analysis tasks are relatively simple; and Excel is equipped to handle these. In this example, Microsoft Excel is used to analyze Kickstarter Data with basic procedures while demonstrating basic tasks in data analytics. While Excel is ofte associated with fields like accounting and bookeeping, statisticians, students, teachers, and anyone who has to do recordkeeping and data collection will find Excel useful for most data analysis. 

## 1.  Deriving NIntermediate Values 
In data analysis, prepaing data for analysis is a basic task that any data analyst must do before performing any procedures on their data. One such task in this category is deriving intermediate values necessary for performing an analysis. This step is not necessary for most data analysis sftware; but is vital in Excel to avoid writing ludicrously complicated instructions for statistical analysis. Intermediate values, by definition, are derived from existing values. These are often statistical constructs like the mean of an arrat of values, the sum of squared deviations, among others. Many statistical formulas require that these values be available. Precalculating intermediate values in advance often saves time spent coding, or allows an analyst to write sorter code. 

In other cases, pderiving intermediate values fromexisting data mis necessary to allow for visualization. For example, a boxplot needs data divided into quartiles; and moat charts need the means of certain categories in order to display. 

## 2. Aggregation 
Aggregation of data is another basic task for data analysts
