# Analysis-of-Kickstarter-Data-via-Excel-

Microsoft Excel is the most basic tool in a Data Analyst's toolbox. Most data analysis tasks are relatively simple; and Excel is equipped to handle these. In this example, Microsoft Excel is used to analyze Kickstarter Data with basic procedures while demonstrating basic tasks in data analytics. While Excel is ofte associated with fields like accounting and bookeeping, statisticians, students, teachers, and anyone who has to do recordkeeping and data collection will find Excel useful for basic data analysis.

## Deriving Intermediate Values 
In data analysis, prepaing data for analysis is a basic task that any data analyst must do before performing any procedures on their data. One such task in this category is deriving intermediate values necessary for performing an analysis. This step is not necessary for most data analysis sftware; but is vital in Excel to avoid writing ludicrously complicated instructions for statistical analysis. Intermediate values, by definition, are derived from existing values. These are often statistical constructs like the mean of an arrat of values, the sum of squared deviations, among others. Many statistical formulas require that these values be available. Precalculating intermediate values in advance often saves time spent coding, or allows an analyst to write sorter code. 

In other cases, pderiving intermediate values fromexisting data mis necessary to allow for visualization. For example, a boxplot needs data divided into quartiles; and moat charts need the means of certain categories in order to display. 

## Aggregation 
Aggregation of data is another basic task for data analysts. Descriptive statitics are among the most practically useful values. This is a task where Excel shines. An Excel user has access to Excel functions that can easly return most basic values in descriptive statistics with nary a need for further coding. Another method of aggregation is pivot tables, which require some planning to execute. Pivot tables can produce frequency counts, and means if executed properly. In addition, Excel allows an analst to easily generate these tables and translate them into charts. The work of aggregation culminates in the generation of summary tables that display these summary statistics for variables of interest. 

## Visualization
The last, but by no means least important, jb of the Data Analyst is to display data in easily comprehensible visual form. In some cases, this is accomplished by nothing more than a simple summary table; but manny people might prefer more elaborate charts and graphs. Excel prvides an easy way to generate various visualizations from data. For this example, bar charts and stacked bar charts are demonstrated for discrete data and frqency counts;and a line chart is used to show change over time. Visualization is a powerful too in a data analysts arsenal. 

## Analysis
The simplicity of Excel does not prevent an astute analyst from performing analyses on this application. As shown in the final part of this exercise, summary statistics can be used to make recommendations; and to tell a story with data. For example, this analysis demonstrates that a clear majority of Kickstarter projects meet their funding goals; that popular culture projects make up the majority of kickstarter projects; and that successful crowdfunding appears to be less influenced by category or seasonal variability than by factors not considered in the analysis. Moreover, the data contained outliers that skewed basic descriptive statistics The questions this inquiry needed to answer cannot be addressed by simple Excel analyses. More thorough analyses than are allowed by Excel will need to be used.  

Overall, this example shows that it isn't the instrument in a data analyst's hands that matters; Data is poetry; mere words until the right analyst can set it to music and make it sing.
